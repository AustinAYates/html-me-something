          <h2>The Story</h2>
        <p>
          Now, this is a story all about how<br>
          My life got flipped-turned upside down<br>
          And I'd like to take a minute<br>
          Just sit right there<br>
          I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air</p>

          <h2>History and West Philadelphia</h2>
        <p>
          In west Philadelphia born and raised<br>
          On the playground was where I spent most of my days<br>
          Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool<br>
          And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school<br>
          When a couple of guys who were up to no good<br>
          Started making trouble in my neighborhood<br>
          I got in one little fight and my mom got scared<br>
          She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'</p>

            <h2>Cab Capers</h2>
          <p>
          I whistled for a cab and when it came near<br>
          The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror<br>
          If anything I could say that this cab was rare<br>
          But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Bel Air'</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
          I pulled up to the house about seven or eight<br>
          And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes, smell ya later!'<br>
          I looked at my kingdom<br>
          I was finally there<br>
          To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air<br>
